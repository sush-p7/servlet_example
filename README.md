# servlet_example
## Description

This code is an example of a simple Java web application that uses the Jakarta Servlet API to create a basic "Hello, [Name]" response. It demonstrates how to handle a POST request and retrieve a parameter value from the request. The code is structured as a servlet, which is a Java class that extends the `HttpServlet` class.

The `HelloServlet` class initializes a `message` variable with the value "Hello " in the `init()` method. It then overrides the `doPost()` method to handle HTTP POST requests. Inside the `doPost()` method, it retrieves the value of the parameter named "t1" from the request using `request.getParameter()`. It then writes a response to the client's browser using the `PrintWriter` object obtained from the `response` object. The response consists of the concatenated message and the retrieved parameter value.

The code also includes the `destroy()` method, which is empty in this example. This method is called when the servlet is being taken out of service and can be used to perform cleanup tasks.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Create a new Java project in your preferred development environment.
3. Create a new package (e.g., `com.example.firstserver`) in your project.
4. Inside the package, create a new Java class named `HelloServlet` and copy the provided code into it.
5. Build and deploy the project to a Java Servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat.
6. Start the server and access the servlet using the specified URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/hello-servlet).
7. Submit a POST request to the servlet with a parameter named "t1" to see the response.
